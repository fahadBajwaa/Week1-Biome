The src (source) folder contains the original, unprocessed code written by developers. This includes:​

- JavaScript or TypeScript files
- CSS or SCSS stylesheets
- HTML templates
- Images and other assets used during development​


These files are typically written using modern syntax and tools, such as ES6+ JavaScript, JSX for React, or SCSS for styling. 
They are not optimized for production and often require processing before deployment.
