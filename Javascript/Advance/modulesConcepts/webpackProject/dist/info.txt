The dist (distribution) folder contains the processed, optimized code ready for deployment to production. This includes:​

- Bundled and minified JavaScript files
- Compiled CSS files
- Optimized images and other assets
- The final index.html file​

Tools like Webpack, Babel, or other build systems process the contents of the src folder and output the results into the dist folder. 
This ensures that the deployed application is efficient and compatible with various browsers.
